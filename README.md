# TEKsys_Python

A very simple script used to transverse a directory's children and count the number of files containing a provided regular expression.

The first input is an absolute path to the initial or root directory.  
Example:
```
/Users/username/Desktop/python_project/
```

The second input is a regular expression.
Example:
```
[a-z]+ample
```

To run the script:
```
python3 script.py
```

To test the script:
```
python3 script_test.py
```
Note: test-dir is a directory designed for testing purposes.
